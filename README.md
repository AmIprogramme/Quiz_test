# Quiz Test
Hello everyone, this project is a simple and normal exercise the include threads and a simple logic.

## Content
The program consiste in 4 random questions of popular culture, when you answer one question correctly, you continue the other question normaly until end the last one. After that, you will get a final score of your progress and how many attempts you needed for get there.

## About the code

In the form of "Welcome" you will see 6 "Usecontrol" that gonna be the main process in all the trip, starting the class  `Main_menu` and finishing over the class `Results`.

> `public partial class Welcome : Form
{

    #region Global variables

        #region Use control variables
    private Main_menu m_menu = new Main_menu();
    private first_quiz f_quiz = new first_quiz();
    private second_quiz s_quiz = new second_quiz();
    private Thrid_quiz thr_quiz = new Thrid_quiz();
    private Forth_quiz four_quiz = new Forth_quiz();
    private Results _Results = new Results();

    #endregion`
Then, the important part of the program is the list of questions and answers that going to be an important element inside the other process, and also, the table of score evaluating in all moment of the questions answers made by the user:

        #region Other variables
    private List<Answers_and_Questions>? list_for_contest = new List<Answers_and_Questions>();
    // With this list we use it in all the quiz a establish between the main form.
    
    private Score_records table_of_score_achieve = new Score_records();
    // Also, the list will be follow with the table score in all moment.

Starting the program, the main menu has to being present at the beginning of the aplication, so, at the moment when the interface is created, it gonna use the object `m_menu` visualazing the buttons and title of the object.

        protected void install_Main_menu() 
    {
        m_menu.return_of_instance_Welcome(this);
        // It sends the instance for modificate the elements in our present form
    
        panel_general.Controls.Add(m_menu); // Add the element of Main_menu to the panel.
    
        f_quiz.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
        f_quiz.BringToFront();
    }
And now, only wait the user press the buttom for starting all the fun, the button will be pressed inside the funtionality of the panel of `Main_menu`:

Inside the Main_menu:

    private void start_btn_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
    {
        object_welcome.start_quiz();
    }

Inside "Welcome":

    public void start_quiz()
    {
        list_for_contest = Questions_generator.Initialize();
     
        first_quiz.return_of_instance_Welcome(this);
    
        panel_general.Controls.Add(f_quiz);
        f_quiz.Dock = DockStyle.Fill;
        f_quiz.BringToFront();
    
        f_quiz.declare_the_list(list_for_contest!, table_of_score_achieve);
       
        f_quiz.start_the_questions();
    
    }

One thing the form "Welcome" is it gonna send few classes and carateristics from there to the other instances, those elements are: 
    
>    1.  list_for_contest 
>      2. table_of_score_achieve
>      3. And the instance `Welcome`

     
The last one, is with the prupose of modificate elements after any event modifcate and access to elements inside the instance `Welcome` like: 
   
    object_welcome.return_of_questions_modified(List<Answers_and_Questions> , Score_records)

Returning elements modificated and re-use it into the next questions.

    public void return_of_questions_modified(List<Answers_and_Questions> returned, Score_records tsa)
    {
        /*The use of variable avoinding the static caracteristics elements, is implemented
         the use of copies and modifications. During the main form, is declared the list of 
        questions and score separated, and then during the quiz code it returns those elements
        modificated for the next quiz and repeat the process.
        */
        table_of_score_achieve = tsa; // tsa means Table of Score Achieve
        list_for_contest = returned;
    
        btn_next_question.Visible = true; // Finished here, the process open the button for next question.

}

## How is setted the list of question?

During this process, the class `Questions_generator.Initialize()`will prepare all the list of question generated by the programmer with a list of:

 

>  1. One question.
 2. One answer.
 3.  9 posible solutions
 4. One explanation.

## Processing the questions

On this part of the code, we gonna set variables with one in particular, this is the `Mixer_questions`, this element help mixing all question sending the list of questions and returning one element that we will use for the contest:

 

    #region Variables
     private Answers_and_Questions? array_mix_questions = new Answers_and_Questions();
     private Mixer_questions object_for_mix = new Mixer_questions();
    
     private List<Answers_and_Questions> list_for_contest = new List<Answers_and_Questions>();
    
     private static Welcome object_welcome = new Welcome();
    
     private Score_records table_of_score_achieve = new Score_records();
    
     private int final_score = 4;
     #endregion

Then, the questions is generated:


        #region Start questions
        public void start_the_questions()
        {
            // Declare "array_mix_questions" for prepare for the test.
            array_mix_questions = object_for_mix.return_of_elements_mixed(list_for_contest);

            bool end_start_question = true;

            do
            {
                if (array_mix_questions != null)
                {
                    btn_aswer_1.Text = array_mix_questions.Wrong_Answers![0];
                    btn_aswer_2.Text = array_mix_questions.Wrong_Answers![1];
                    btn_aswer_3.Text = array_mix_questions.Wrong_Answers![2];
                    btn_aswer_4.Text = array_mix_questions.Wrong_Answers![3];

                   
                    Task.Run(() => write_question(array_mix_questions.Main_question!));
                    GB_buttons.Invoke(new Action(() => GB_buttons.Enabled = true));
                    end_start_question = false;
                }
                else
                {
                   MessageBox.Show("The Array is null");
                }

            } while (end_start_question);

        }
        #endregion

Meanwhile the process `write_question(String )` write the question word by word asyncronic: 

    private async Task write_question(String message_q)
    {
        txt_quiestion_generated.Invoke(new
             Action(() => txt_quiestion_generated.Clear()));
    
        foreach (var word in message_q.ToArray())
        {
            if (txt_quiestion_generated.InvokeRequired)
            {
                txt_quiestion_generated.Invoke(new Action(() => txt_quiestion_generated.AppendText(word.ToString())));
                await Task.Delay(50);
            }
        }
    }

Now, the user will choose one answer with the buttons:

     #region Buttons
     private void btn_aswer_1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)

Finally, if the chosen answer is correct, the process will delete the eventual question avoiding repeat it again:

    #region Remove and return list modified
